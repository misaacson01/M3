![3 base parts (floor panel, wall panel, and junction) create a variety of maze configurations](https://github.com/misaacson01/M3/blob/gh-pages/img/M3intro.png)

The Modular Mouse Maze (**M3** for short) is a collection of hardware, code, and instructions/tutorials used for mouse behavioral research. M3 is designed around a small number of 3D printable parts and easily connectable, off-the-shelf IIC electronics (including Adafruit's [stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) and Sparkfun's [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) systems), offering an inexpensive, simple, and highly customizable approach to building a variety of experimental apparatuses and automated protocols, with no cutting of materials and (for most mazes) no soldering required!

## How to get started?
Want to build a new mouse maze? Simply select a maze from the menubar above. Following the link, you'll find:
1. A list of parts to purchase and 3D designs to print (either on your own printer or ordered online)
2. Microcontroller code to download (for automated mazes)
3. Step-by-step instructions for how to put it all together
