## What is M3?

The Modular Mouse Maze (**M3** for short) is a collection of hardware, code, and instructions/tutorials used for mouse behavioral research. M3 is designed around a small number of 3D printable parts and easily connectable, off-the-shelf IIC electronics (including Adafruit's [stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) and Sparkfun's [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) systems), offering an inexpensive, simple, and highly customizable approach to building a variety of experimental apparatuses, with no cutting of materials or soldering required. Set up classical/operant assays and automated data collection in less time, for less money!

## How to get started?
Want to build a mouse behavioral assay yourself? Simply select a maze from the menubar above. Following the link, you'll find:
1. A list of parts to purchase and 3D designs (.stl files) to print (either on your own printer or ordered online)
2. Arduino code to download (if the maze is automated)
3. Step-by-step instructions for how to put it all together
