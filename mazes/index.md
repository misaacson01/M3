# Custom mazes with a modular design

This site contains instructions for building a handful of different maze types using a common set of 3D printed parts, such as the [Y-maze](https://misaacson01.github.io/M3/mazes/ymaze/ymaze/), [open field](https://misaacson01.github.io/M3/mazes/openfield/openfield/), or [linear track](https://misaacson01.github.io/M3/mazes/linear/linear/). Selet a maze type from the menubar above to find assembly details for different variations of the maze type. Once you get a feel for how the [parts](https://misaacson01.github.io/M3/parts/) come together to create these example mazes, you'll be able to create many more mazes than those listed here. Happy building!
