# 3D printed parts for configurable maze shapes

The 3D designed parts listed on this page have been designed to be printed using inexpensive 3D printers, such as the [Prusa mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/). The .stl file for each part is print-ready; check out the [how to 3D print](https://misaacson01.github.io/M3/help/howtoprint) page for more details on how to order these parts or to print them yourself.
