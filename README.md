# M3

The Modular Mouse Maze (a.k.a. "M3") is an experimental system for building custom mazes for mouse behavioral research.

## 3D printed construction

3D printed panels and connectors can be arranged and rearranged freely to support a variety of configurations (e.g. y-mazes, t-mazes, linear tracks, open fields).


## Automation with I2C electronics

Off-the-shelf electronics using the I2C communication protocol and 4-pin JST connectors can be used with the M3 to automate mouse location tracking, delivering cues and rewards, and automating experimental protocols.
